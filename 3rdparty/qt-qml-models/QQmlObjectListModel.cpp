    \class QQmlObjectListModel

    \ingroup QT_QML_MODELS

    \brief Provides a generic way to generate a list model from QObject derived class, suitable for QML

    QQmlObjectListModel is a convenience subclass \c QAbstractListModel that makes use of C++ templates
    and Qt Meta Object to extract properties from a \c QObject derived class and create according roles
    inside the model.

    This is a far better way than to expose directly a \c QList<QObject *> inside a \c QVariant.

    And this is far simpler than doing all Qt model stuff manually : no subclassing or reimplementing need.

    The class was designed so that most of the added API is really common with \c QList one.

    \b Note : Simply needs that the class used for items inherits \c QObject and has Qt Meta Properties.

/*!
    \fn static QQmlObjectListModel * QQmlObjectListModel::create (QObject * parent = Q_NULLPTR)

    \details A factory to create a new model from a class that will be used as item type.

    \tparam ItemType The class to use as item
    \param parent The owner object for the model
    \return The newly created and configurerd model

    This is a template method, meant to be used like this :
    \code
        QQmlObjectListModel * myModel = QQmlObjectListModel::create<MyItemClass>(this);
    \endcode

    No other customization in needed after that.

    to the model, because it could have some side-effects.
