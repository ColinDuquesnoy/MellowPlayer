You can turn this feature off:

**Application > Preferences > Notifications**: uncheck the notifications you're not interested in.

MPRIS2 Interface
----------------

Most GNU/Linux Desktop Environments have a MPRIS client interface that sits
in the system tray and let you control media players easily.

MellowPlayer implements the DBUS MPRIS 2 interface and should appear in your MPRIS2
client interface:
