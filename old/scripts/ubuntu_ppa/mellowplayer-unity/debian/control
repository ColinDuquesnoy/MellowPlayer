Description: Cloud music integration for your Unity desktop!
 MellowPlayer is a free, open source and cross-platform desktop application
 that runs web-based music streaming services in its own window and provides 
 integration with your desktop (hotkeys, multimedia keys, system tray,
 and more).
 Supported services:
   - Grooveshark (retro and mobile)
   - Soundcloud
   - Mixcloud
   - Deezer
 This flavour of MellowPlayer has been tweaked for the Unity desktop.
