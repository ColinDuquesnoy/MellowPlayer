## 1.4

### 1.4.0

**New features:**

- Remove grooveshark plugins since the service has shutdown
- Add [Rdio](http://rdio.com) integration (HTML5 service, free with audio ads)
- UI improvements: remove the confusing stop action from the menus (all the supported services
don't have a stop action, just pause).
- OSX improvements:
- Add a dock menu with play/pause, next, previous and add to favorites action
- Use the same behaviour as on Ubuntu: no minimize to tray (tray is used just for messages), quit/close exits the
  application
- Make flash an optional runtime dependency: flash plugins won't get enabled (even if installed) except
for the service that require it (Deezer, Mixcloud and Soundcloud)
- Get rid of Qt4 build support, now MellowPlayer is Qt5 only (even on Windows)

all desktop environments affected)

(or the service status, e.g. Loading or Stopped)

**Fixed bugs:**

- Select service dialog: don't reload page if service has not changed but user
choose OK.
- Prevent the "Stopped" notification from being shown when switching service
- Use restoreWindow instead of show to make sure the main window is active
before showing any preference dialog.


## 1.2

## 1.1

### 1.1.1

Use grooveshark retro instead of the new grooveshark website.
The new website does not work well with QtWebkit (freeze on large collection, completely unusable).
We will reintroduce the official grooveshark as soon as QtWebEngine starts supporting flash.

### 1.1.0

**New features**

- New notification systems: use KNotification on KDE Sc/Plasma 5 and notify-send on other
linux desktop environments. Now we are able to show the track art in the notification popup.

would like to see or hide.
- Show the name of the music streaming service in the window title bar
- Add some command line arguments (e.g. to start with a predefined service or to enable the web inspector).
- Add Travis CI integration (test compilation process + a few functional tests, still no test suite)
- Add a Wiki action to the main window: triggering this action will open a browser to our wiki.

**Fixed bugs**

- Fix a bug which prevented the os from shutting down (logout/shutdown/restart) if the window was visible
- Fix a couple of bugs related to buffering state in various streaming service. Those bugs were not
visible with the old notification system
- Improve mpris interface on other desktops (mainly gnome shell)
- Improve french translation
