Setting up a development environment
------------------------------------

Read the how to setup page of the [wiki](https://gitlab.com/ColinDuquesnoy/MellowPlayer/wikis/how-to-setup)

We also recommend you read the [architecture](https://gitlab.com/ColinDuquesnoy/MellowPlayer/wikis/architecture) and the [coding guidelines](guidelines) pages before hacking on MellowPlayer.

Submitting a pull request
-------------------------

Here are the steps you need to follow to start working on MellowPlayer and submit your work
for evaluation or integration into the main project:

1. Fork the Repo on github.
2. Create a feature or a bugfix branch before you start coding.
3. Add your name to AUTHORS.md
4. Format the code using ``scripts/beautify.sh`` (run it from the root source directory).  
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request to **the master branch**.


Adding support for a new service
--------------------------------

Web streaming service integration plugins are now written in pure javascript.

1. Create a new plugin using the wizard (see http://mellowplayer.readthedocs.io/en/webengine/developers/plugins.html#create-a-new-plugin)
2. Edit ``metadata.ini`` (add correct url, name, version,...)
3. Edit ``description.html`` to describe the streaming service
4. Customise logo.svg
5. Implement the needed functions in ``integration.js``
6. Once your plugin works, submit a pull request!
